## Overall Experience
I LOVED THIS ASSIGNMENT. I haven't done a coding internship or coded fullstack-applications in a long time, since my interests and motivations have shifted. But this assignment was so much fun and brought me back to the joy of fullstack.

## Difficulty

What I really enjoyed was the ability to use AI tools to help me with this assignment. AI tools have sped up my coding process when I am stuck on a bug or implementation issue. It's insane how Context or Cursor can help me figure out best design and code implementations. Before, I would be stuck on Stack Overflow or Google for hours trying to figure out how to implement a feature.

It was nice how this assignment was broken down into smaller pieces and I could focus on one concept at a time. I could also use the Context tool to help me figure out the best design and code implementations for each concept. Great job to the staff team for putting this assignment together.

What was difficult was actually launching to production. I've launched many apps before, and I know there is always a hiccup when things go live. I was already prepared for CORS issues, pdf parsing issues, backend machine limitations, etc. I spent around two days figuring out GCS CORS issues and pdf displayability on production.

Another difficult portion was fixing all the little bugs that would show up in the frontend and making sure I could simulate as many edge cases as possible to fix them. It would be pretty annoying that they kept popping up and I had to spend hours fixing them.

Syncs were also a bit difficult to implement. I had to spend a lot of time reading the documentation and understanding how I could turn some of my concepts into syncs. I also had to spend a lot of time debugging the syncs and making sure they were working properly when the frontend would make requests to the backend.


## Skills

I really got good experience with storage and pdf parsing. These are two skills I couldn't get a ton of practice with before in my previous projects. So it was nice to finally learn them and understand how to use them in a real-world application.

I still need to work on my testing skills. I've never really been a fan of testing and I've never really understood the purpose of it. But after this assignment, I understand the importance of testing and how it can help me catch bugs and errors before they happen, even though I feel as if I could test live while coding.

## LLMs

Context was a great tool when it came to helping me create my concepts. I just feel as if it's a bit too verbose and I would rather use an agentic coding tool like Cursor to help me create my concepts. It's much faster and more efficient. However, I understand the teaching team's reasoning for using Context and I think it's a great tool to incrementally build out an application.

Cursor was a great tool when it came to helping me implement my frontend and connect it to the backend. It's much faster and more efficient than using Context. I could just tell Cursor what I wanted to do and it would just do it. It's insane how much it can help me code and I could see myself using it more in the future. It helped me learn a ton as well about best code practices and methods that I would never have known about otherwise. Cursor is a great tool to debug as well and it saves me a ton of headaches.

I think LLMs are a great tool to help you code and debug. They can help you create your concepts and implement your frontend and backend. They can also help you debug and catch bugs and errors before they happen. However, I think they are not a replacement for the creativity and problem-solving skills of a human developer. They are not a replacement for the understanding of the codebase and the application. They are not a replacement for the ability to think critically and solve problems.
