# App Design Changes

## Summary of Changes Made

### Added Concepts

I added a user authentication concept to handle user registration and login

I also added a library concept that stores links to the user's books in Google Cloud Storage.

### Key Design Decisions

After reading the Piazza for this assignment, I started thinking more about how I would actually store the user's books. I was initially thinking of storing them in MongoDB, but that wouldn't be very efficient. Thankfully, Piazza helped me realize that I should use Google Cloud Storage to store the books. I did not implement this functionality yet for this assignment, but I plan to do so after working a bit on the frontend assignments.
